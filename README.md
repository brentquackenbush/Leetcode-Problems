# Data Structure and Algorithms

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Algorithms

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- In-place Reversal of LinkedList
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Subsets
- Top 'K' Elements
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Toplogical Sort (Graphs)

## Data Structures
Known as auxillary data structure if used to solve an algorithm. 
Something you might use to solve a given problem and is terminated after the problem is solved.
- HashMap
- TreeMap
- Linked List
- Array
- 2d Array
- ArrayList
- HashSet
- Trie
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- PriorityQueue
- Graph
